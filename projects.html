		<p style="font-size: 25px">Being a student I am trying to develop myself in all possible ways, especially
		in art, which is tightly connected with my major of Contemporary Communication.
		This is the field I feel
		I can pursue arts in all ways of communication, technology, politics and physical pieces of art.
		One of my latest and the most professional projects for now is the Art Club persuasive campaign for my 
		Persuasion and Propaganda class.
		I have done this campaign together with a group of 4 more LCC students.
